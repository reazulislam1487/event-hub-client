### 📜 Project Overview

**Event Hub** is a full-stack MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) application designed to streamline event creation, management, and participation. It offers a responsive, secure, and intuitive experience for both organizers and attendees.

Users can register/login, add events, browse events with filters, join events (once per user), and view their joined list — all in a clean and elegant UI built with Tailwind CSS and enhanced by Framer Motion.
